# Classify traditional Vietnamese-cakes using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Desciption
>#### The data collected by Huy Do (https://github.com/dobhuy) is then preprocessed and entered into the CNN model to train and evaluate the classification. 
> Huy Do has curated a comprehensive dataset of images showcasing various Vietnamese cakes, each meticulously labeled by type. Then, I preprocess these images to extract key features, such as texture, color, shape, and other distinctive visual attributes. Leveraging this data, I designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for multi-class classification. This model can analyze images of cakes uploaded by users and provide instant classification results, helping to promote and preserve Vietnam's rich culinary heritage.
